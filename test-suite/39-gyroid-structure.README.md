# Gyroid Structure Test - Mathematical Surface Limitation

## What This Test Attempts

This test tries to create a gyroid minimal surface approximation by:
- Evaluating the implicit function: sin(x)cos(y) + sin(y)cos(z) + sin(z)cos(x) = 0
- Creating small cubes at points near the zero level set of this function
- Building up a 3D approximation of the gyroid surface

## The Limitation Discovered

### Expected Output:
A complex, continuous 3D surface with:
- Characteristic gyroid triply periodic minimal surface pattern
- Smooth, interconnected curved surfaces
- No self-intersections, creating two interpenetrating labyrinths

### Actual Output:
A simplified star-like or cross-shaped structure that bears little resemblance to a gyroid.

## The Issue

The mathematical surface generation approach is not working as intended:

1. **Discrete cube approximation** - Using individual cubes to approximate a continuous surface creates a fundamentally different structure
2. **Implicit function evaluation** - The threshold-based approach (|val| < thickness) may not capture the surface correctly
3. **Missing connectivity** - Individual cubes don't merge into a continuous surface

## Why This Approach Fails

1. **OpenSCAD limitation** - OpenSCAD doesn't have native support for implicit surface rendering
2. **Voxel approach** - Creating thousands of tiny cubes is computationally expensive and doesn't create smooth surfaces
3. **No marching cubes** - Proper implicit surface rendering requires algorithms like marching cubes, which OpenSCAD doesn't support

## Correct Approach

To create a true gyroid in OpenSCAD would require:
- Pre-computing the surface mesh externally
- Importing as STL or using polyhedron() with pre-calculated vertices
- Or using a different tool designed for implicit surface modeling

## Key Takeaway

OpenSCAD is not well-suited for rendering mathematical implicit surfaces. While it excels at CSG operations on primitive shapes, generating smooth surfaces from mathematical equations requires different approaches than what OpenSCAD provides.
